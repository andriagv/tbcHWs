# 🍌 Catch the Banana – UIKit Mini-Game

A fast-paced and addictive **arcade-style game** built entirely with **UIKit** and **Swift**.  
The player must catch bananas to score points — but there's a twist: **miss one banana and the game is over!**

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

### 🍌 Catch the Bananas  
- Bananas fall from the top of the screen.  
- Catching a banana earns points.  
- Missing a banana ends the game immediately — you have **only one life**!

### 🐒 Wild Bananas (Bonus)  
- Occasionally, a special **wild banana** appears.  
- Catching it gives **extra points**, rewarding quick reflexes.  
- Wild bananas fall faster and are rarer.

### 🔊 Background Music  
- Dynamic music enhances the fast-paced arcade vibe.  
- Sound effects play on every interaction (catch, miss, bonus).

### ⚡ Increasing Difficulty  
- Bananas (and wild bananas) fall faster over time.  
- Reflexes are tested more and more as the game continues.

### 🎲 Randomized Drops  
- Bananas fall from **random positions**, ensuring a different experience every game.

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

- 📱 **UIKit-based UI** — Fully programmatic interface using UIKit.
- 👆 **Touch-Based Controls** — Move the catcher horizontally to grab bananas.
- 🎨 **Custom ViewControllers** — Game logic and layout are managed via `UIViewController` subclasses.
- 🧠 **Game Logic Includes**:
  - Score tracking
  - Special banana logic
  - Collision detection
  - Game over handling
  - Animated object spawning

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- 🧾 **Swift**
- 🧩 **UIKit** (Programmatic UI)
- 🎵 **AVFoundation** – Music and sound playback
- 🔧 **Auto Layout** – Manual constraints for multiple screen support
- 🎞 **Image-based Animations** – Object movement mimics sprite-like behavior

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project demonstrates:

- UIKit animation & gesture handling  
- Custom game loop logic without SpriteKit  
- Interactive UI with real-time user feedback  
- Data modeling for arcade-like mechanics  
- Building scalable UIKit-based games
